    "text2": "Task Force - 13 Invictus was the first Indonesian squadron to achieve a top 50 global leaderboard ranking in season III 2020 of War Thunder. Building on this achievement, the squadron continued to improve their skills, strategies, and coordination, eventually reaching a top 20 global leaderboard ranking in season I 2021, another first for an Indonesian squadron. Invictus's success can be attributed to several key factors, including their exceptional skill, communication, teamwork, and dedication. The squadron worked together to develop effective tactics, utilizing each member's strengths to create a cohesive and effective fighting force. They also placed a strong emphasis on clear communication, utilizing tactical overlays to stay informed of the battlefield situation. Through extensive practice and analysis, Invictus honed their abilities and developed effective countermeasures to common enemy strategies. Their perseverance and hard work paid off, as they established themselves as a top squadron in the War Thunder community, setting the standard for other Indonesian squadrons to follow.",
